/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 * since the question is asked about the some extra operation on the nums array, which is like checking the nums[i] & nums[i+1] since when every we are dealing with such 
 * kind of question my approach is always taking a element from the array index i as  1 and checking the i-1 equality and if that satisfy apply operations to it.
 * in this way we don't have to check the additional checks like writing this way 
 * for(let i=0 ; i<num.length-1;i++){ since we are starting from i=0 we hav to check till n-1 of length}
 * aslo please remeber that in the below code i have checked nums[i]!=0 is to aviod unneccery operations. which is of no use , so that why i kept nums[i]!=0;
 * the rest we all know that moving zero to the end.
